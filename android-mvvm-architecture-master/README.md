# Dopay Coding Challenge Android MVVM Architecture with Java,Kotlin,Android Architectural Components,Jetpack,Dagger,RxJava/RxAndroid,RxNetworking.

Integrating the youtube api (setup key required) list the most popular videos:

https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list

Add a filter to filter by the below categories:

Provide the ability to page the list 10 at a time (prev, next).

Enable the playback of the videos via a Play button or by clicking the video thumbnail.

Use the default styling of the given platform and expected UI components.

Ensure your tests run and provide a working build if possible.

Please provide the code on github or a repo of your choosing for review.

Application Developed Using AndroidSdk.

Technolgies Used :- Java,Kotlin,Android Architectural Components

The app has following packages:
data: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
di: Dependency providing classes using Dagger2.
ui: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
utils: Utility classes.
Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.
